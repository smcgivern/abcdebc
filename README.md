The game [The Fool and His Money][tfahm] has a [puzzle][lawley] near the
beginning where you are given a list of letters that make a sentence. The order
that you click on the letters determines where they go in the sentence. I think
of this as 'reverse hangman', because the letters are already known.
Unfortunately, although [opinions differ][computer-guesses] on
[what exactly][lookup] reverse hangman [is][missing-letters], none of them match
the game I've just described!

That's why I called this, a clone of the one found in The Fool and His Money,
[Abcdebc][abcdebc]. (It's the pattern of the letters in the word hangman.)
